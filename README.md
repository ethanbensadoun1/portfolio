## Education			        		
B.A., Applied Mathematics in Statistcs and Economics | McGill University (_June 2024_)

## Summary 
I have recently graduated from McGill University where I double majored in Applied Mathematics in Statistics and Economics. During my time as a student I was exposed to a variety of theoretical and practical topics in Data Science:

- Probability
- Statistics
- Statistical Computing 
- Applied Regression
- Generalized Linear Models (data/model fitting and quality assurance)
- Stochastic Processes and Modelling (discrete and continuous)
- Sampling Theory and Applications 
- Fundamentals of Statistical Learning (i.e., mathematics for machine learning)
- Econometrics

## Work Experience
**Trading Analyst Intern @ Spectra FX Solutions, NY, United States (_Summer 2023_)**
- Analyzed and monitored risk exposures by tracking currency pair positions and assessing market volatility
- Conducted global market research and analyzed data regarding economic indicators that impact currency values
- Proposed quantitative derivative strategies for currency options traders to mitigate their risk profiles
- Triggered multiple transactions among clients which generated substantial revenue for the company

## Projects
**Stock Portfolio Simulation - Monte Carlo Experiment**
Iâ€™ve developed a custom stock portfolio using a Monte Carlo simulation, leveraging data from Yahoo Finance. The code demonstrates how to harness historical stock data to model potential future returns and assess portfolio performance. By incorporating statistical techniques and financial principles, this simulation allows for a nuanced evaluation of investment strategies, helping to optimize and tailor a portfolio based on historical trends and projected outcomes. 

By running the a loop for each simulated iteration, I generated multiple paths for the portfolio's future value, allowing you to estimate potential outcomes and risks. Below I generated a graph that visualizes many different potential future paths for the portfolio's value. Each line represents one possible outcome for the portfolio, based on the Monte Carlo simulation.
